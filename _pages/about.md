Grew up in Greece, currently based in Brussels and working as DevOps/Software Engineer at Riaktr. Obtained my MEng in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and conducted my thesis in cooperation with KU Leuven. Curious about the world around us, tech enthusiast, genuine problem-solver and restless innovation seeker, I have dealt, managed and worked on different engineering projects and topics; from developing and building a custom Virtual Reality platform for neuroscience experiments to being involved in the design, implementation and testing of a Formula-style race car and designing/writing software by leveraging DevOps solutions for Riaktr. As I highly value entrepreneurship and innovation I am always open for discussion or opportunities. If any of these sounds interesting, don't hesitate to contact me.
